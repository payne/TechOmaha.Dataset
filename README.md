This is a TechOmaha dataset with TechOmaha.json being the primary data file
holding data from the existing website.  Folks could then use this when building a TechOmaha website for fun or class.   Folders in here hold images from the website.


Here's a simple REPL for looking at things from the JSON: https://repl.it/@payne/TechOmahaDataSetPlay


Please fork and play with this https://codepen.io/payne/full/VggYym that draws a web page using the dataset.   Please tweet to @MattPayneOrg with anything you create?
